Sometimes you want to :monkey: around a bit and add some :star2: to your :speech_balloon:. Well we have a gift for you:

:zap: You can use emoji anywhere GitLab Flavored Markdown is supported. :v:

You can use it to point out a :bug: or warn about :speak_no_evil: patches. And if someone improves your really :snail: code, send them some :birthday:. People :heart: you for that.

If you're new to this, don't be :fearful:. You can join the emoji :family:. Just look up one of the supported codes.

Consult the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.emojicopy.com) for a list of all supported emoji codes. :thumbsup:

Here's a line for us to start with.

This longer line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it is a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
These lines are only separated by single newlines,
so they *do not break* and just follow the previous lines
in the *same paragraph*.

- This line links to [a section on a different Markdown page, using a "#" and the header ID](documentation.md#overview)

- This line links to [a different section on the same page, using a "#" and the header ID](#testing-header-anchor1)
- - This line links to [a different section on the same page, using a "#" and the header ID](#header-ids-and-links)
